    "\n",
    "- When downcasting a model, you convert the model's parameters to a more compact data type (bfloat16).  During inference, the model performs its calculations in this data type, and its activations are in this data type.  Downcasting may work with the bfloat16 data type, but the model performance will likely degrade with any smaller data type, and won't work if you convert to an integer data type (like the int8 in this lesson).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this lesson, you used another quantization method, \"linear quantization\", which enables the quantized model to maintain performance much closer to the original model by converting from the compressed data type back to the original FP32 data type during inference. So when the model makes a prediction, it is performing the matrix multiplications in FP32, and the activations are in FP32.  This enables you to quantize the model in data types smaller than bfloat16, such as int8, in this example."
