    "TensorFlow Lite is a runtime that enables on-device machine learning by helping developers run their models on mobile, embedded, and edge devices. The models produced by TensorFlow Lite work on multiple platform support, covering Android and iOS devices, embedded Linux, and microcontrollers. The toolchain also has diverse language support, which includes Java, Swift, Objective-C, C++, and Python.\n",

    "In the context of TensorFlow Lite, \"delegation\" refers to the use of delegates to enable hardware acceleration of machine learning models on mobile and edge devices. Delegates act as a bridge between TensorFlow Lite and on-device accelerators like GPUs and DSPs, optimizing performance and efficiency by leveraging specialized hardware capabilities. This process can significantly improve the speed and power consumption of running machine learning models on such devices. For more details, you can visit the TensorFlow Lite Delegates page.\n",
