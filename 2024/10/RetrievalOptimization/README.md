Dear learner, 

 

We're excited to introduce [Retrieval Optimization: From Tokenization to Vector Quantization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/retrieval-optimization-from-tokenization-to-vector-quantization/), a short course made in collaboration with Qdrant, and taught by Kacper Łukawski, its Developer Relations Lead.

 

In this course, you'll learn about tokenization and vector search optimization for large-scale customer-facing RAG applications. You'll learn about the technical details of how vector search works and how to optimize it for better performance.

 

By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of how tokenization is done and how to optimize vector search in your RAG systems.

Here's what you'll learn, in detail:

  -  Understand the internal workings of embedding models and how your text turns into vectors.
  -  Explore how different tokenization techniques like Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece, and Unigram, work and affect search relevance.
  -  Learn how to measure the quality of your search across several quality metrics.
  -  Understand how the main parameters in HNSW, a graph-based algorithm, affect the relevance and speed of vector search and how to optimally adjust these parameters.
  -  Experiment with the three major quantization methods –product, scalar, and binary – and learn how they impact memory requirements, search quality, and speed.

Join in and take your RAG applications to the next level!

## Details
- Learn how tokenization works in large language and embedding models and how the tokenizer can affect the quality of your search.

- Explore how different tokenization techniques including Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece, and Unigram are trained and work.

- Understand how to measure the quality of your retrieval and how to optimize your search by adjusting HNSW parameters and vector quantizations.
