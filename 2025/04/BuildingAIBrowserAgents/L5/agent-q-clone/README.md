# agentq - advanced reasoning and learning for autonomous AI agents

agentq utilises various kinds of agentic architectures to complete a task on the web reliably.
it has

```
1. a planner <> navigator multi-agent architecutre
2. a solo planner-actor agent
3. an actor <> critic multi-agent architecture
4. actor <> critic architecture + monte carlo tree search based reinforcement learning + dpo finetuning
```

this repo also contains an oss implementation of the research paper [agent q](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07199) - thus the name.

### setup

1. we recommend installing poetry before proceeding with the next steps. you can install poetry using these [instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

2. install dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```

3. start chrome in dev mode - in a seaparate terminal, use the command to start a chrome instance and do necesssary logins to job websites like linkedin/ wellfound, etc.

for mac, use command -

```bash
sudo /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

for linux -

```bash
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

for windows -

```bash
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

4. set up env - add openai and [langfuse](https://langfuse.com) keys to .env file. you can refer .env.example. currently adding langfuse is required. If you do not want tracing - then you can do the following changes

   - directly import open ai client via `import openai` rather than `from langfuse.openai import openai` in the `./agentq/core/agent/base.py` file.
   - you would also have to comment out the @obseve decorator and the below piece of code from the `run` function in the same file

   ```python
   langfuse_context.update_current_trace(
               name=self.agent_name,
               session_id=session_id
         )
   ```

5. run the agent

```bash
python -u -m agentq
```

### run evals

```bash
 python -m test.tests_processor --orchestrator_type fsm
```

### generate dpo pairs for RL

```bash
python -m agentq.core.mcts.browser_mcts
```

#### citations

a bunch of amazing work in the space has inspired this.
