Dear learner, 

 

Learn how to build code agents in [Building Code Agents with Hugging Face smolagents](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/building-code-agents-with-hugging-face-smolagents), our latest short course, built in collaboration with Hugging Face and taught by Thomas Wolf (Co-founder and CSO) and Aymeric Roucher (Project Lead).

 

Most agents today use LLMs to decide which tool to call. These tool-calling agents work step-by-step: call a function, observe, reason, decide what to do next, and repeat. But what if your agent could reason through the entire task and write a block of code to execute the full plan?

 

That’s the idea behind code agents. Instead of generating function calls one by one, they use the LLM to write a complete code snippet that performs a sequence of actions, and then run that code. This leads to more concise, efficient, and reliable behavior, especially in tasks that require multiple steps.

In this course, you’ll:

  -  Compare code agents with traditional tool-calling agents to understand when and why to use each
  -  Use Hugging Face’s smolagents framework to build agents that reason and act through code
  -  Run LLM-generated code securely using sandboxing and a constrained Python interpreter
  -  Monitor and evaluate agent behavior, like tracing runs and debugging issues in complex flows
  -  Build a research agent that retrieves, synthesizes, and organizes online information

Start building agents that write and execute code to perform complex tasks!
