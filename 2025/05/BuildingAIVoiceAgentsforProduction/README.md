Dear learner, 

 

Voice agents are becoming a key way for users to interact with AI. But building one that feels truly conversational requires more than just stitching together a few APIs.

 

We’re excited to introduce Building AI Voice Agents for Production, a short course where you’ll learn how to build a conversational voice agent that listens, reasons, and responds in real-time.

 

Created in collaboration with LiveKit and RealAvatar, and taught by Russ d’Sa, Shayne Parmelee, and Nedelina Teneva, this hands-on course walks you through the architecture used to build Andrew Avatar, a voice agent developed by DeepLearning.AI and RealAvatar that responds in Andrew Ng’s voice. You’ll gain practical skills and a deeper understanding of how modern voice systems are built and optimized.

In detail, you’ll learn:

  -  How to break down a voice agent into core components—speech-to-text, LLMs, and text-to-speech—and how they work together
  -  When to use a modular pipeline vs. speech-to-speech APIs, depending on your goals and use case
  -  How to use WebRTC and LiveKit to stream audio efficiently and reduce latency
  -  How to implement voice activity detection (VAD) and end-of-turn detection to make your agent feel more human
  -  How to handle user interruptions and maintain conversational context over time
  -  How to measure latency across your pipeline—and techniques to reduce it for smoother responses

Whether you’re building a voice-enabled AI assistant, tutor, or customer-facing bot, this course will help you go beyond proof of concept and toward production-ready systems.
