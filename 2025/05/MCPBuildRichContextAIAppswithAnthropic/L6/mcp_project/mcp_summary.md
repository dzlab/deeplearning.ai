The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is built on a flexible, extensible architecture that enables seamless communication between LLM applications and integrations. This document covers the core architectural components and concepts.

## Overview

MCP follows a client-server architecture where:

* **Hosts** are LLM applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that initiate connections
* **Clients** maintain 1:1 connections with servers, inside the host application
* **Servers** provide context, tools, and prompts to clients

## Core components

### Protocol layer

The protocol layer handles message framing, request/response linking, and high-level communication patterns.

Key classes include:

* `Protocol`
* `Client`
* `Server`

### Transport layer

The transport layer handles the actual communication between clients and servers. MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms:

1. **Stdio transport**

   * Uses standard input/output for communication
   * Ideal for local processes
2. **HTTP with SSE transport**

   * Uses Server-Sent Events for server-to-client messages
   * HTTP POST for client-to-server messages

All transports use [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 to exchange messages. See the [specification](/specification) for detailed information about the Model Context Protocol message format.

### Message types

MCP has these main types of messages:

1. **Requests** expect a response from the other side:
2. **Results** are successful responses to requests:
3. **Errors** indicate that a request failed:
4. **Notifications** are one-way messages that don't expect a response:

## Connection lifecycle

### 1. Initialization

1. Client sends `initialize` request with protocol version and capabilities
2. Server responds with its protocol version and capabilities
3. Client sends `initialized` notification as acknowledgment
4. Normal message exchange begins

### 2. Message exchange

After initialization, the following patterns are supported:

* **Request-Response**: Client or server sends requests, the other responds
* **Notifications**: Either party sends one-way messages

### 3. Termination

Either party can terminate the connection:

* Clean shutdown via `close()`
* Transport disconnection
* Error conditions

## Error handling

MCP defines these standard error codes:

SDKs and applications can define their own error codes above -32000.

Errors are propagated through:

* Error responses to requests
* Error events on transports
* Protocol-level error handlers

## Implementation example

Here's a basic example of implementing an MCP server:

## Best practices

### Transport selection

1. **Local communication**

   * Use stdio transport for local processes
   * Efficient for same-machine communication
   * Simple process management
2. **Remote communication**

   * Use SSE for scenarios requiring HTTP compatibility
   * Consider security implications including authentication and authorization

### Message handling

1. **Request processing**

   * Validate inputs thoroughly
   * Use type-safe schemas
   * Handle errors gracefully
   * Implement timeouts
2. **Progress reporting**

   * Use progress tokens for long operations
   * Report progress incrementally
   * Include total progress when known
3. **Error management**

   * Use appropriate error codes
   * Include helpful error messages
   * Clean up resources on errors

## Security considerations

1. **Transport security**

   * Use TLS for remote connections
   * Validate connection origins
   * Implement authentication when needed
2. **Message validation**

   * Validate all incoming messages
   * Sanitize inputs
   * Check message size limits
   * Verify JSON-RPC format
3. **Resource protection**

   * Implement access controls
   * Validate resource paths
   * Monitor resource usage
   * Rate limit requests
4. **Error handling**

   * Don't leak sensitive information
   * Log security-relevant errors
   * Implement proper cleanup
   * Handle DoS scenarios

## Debugging and monitoring

1. **Logging**

   * Log protocol events
   * Track message flow
   * Monitor performance
   * Record errors
2. **Diagnostics**

   * Implement health checks
   * Monitor connection state
   * Track resource usage
   * Profile performance
3. **Testing**

   * Test different transports
   * Verify error handling
   * Check edge cases
   * Load test servers
