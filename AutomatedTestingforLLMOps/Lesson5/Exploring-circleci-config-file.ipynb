    "## Some other features we've used\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we have used other features of CircleCI as well, although we didn't focus on them as much. Despite this, each of the following features was key to building a functional CI/CD pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution environments\n",
    "\n",
    "CircleCI provides many different options for [execution environments](https://circleci.com/docs/executor-intro/) including Docker images, Linux VMs, MacOS VMs, Windows VMs, GPU executors, and even [self-hosted runners](https://circleci.com/docs/runner-overview/) to run jobs on your own infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also run different jobs in the same workflow **on different machines**. Some example use cases for this would be using more expensive and specialized cloud-based GPU executors to train ML models or deploying applications to your own infrastructure after testing them on cloud infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orbs\n",
    "\n",
    "[Orbs](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs) are shareable packages of CircleCI configurations, similar to libraries or packages in conventional software development. CircleCI supports certified orbs, community orbs, and private orbs to bring the same advantages of libraries for product development to configuration development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "Security is paramount for any application. You shouldn't include credentials and other sensitive information (known as secrets) in your CircleCI configuration file, as it will be committed to your code repositories where it can potentially be exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Contexts](https://circleci.com/docs/contexts/#create-and-use-a-context) allow you to securely store certain credentials in one centralized location on CircleCI's infrastructure for access during certain workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, you can see that we've been using the `dl-ai-courses` context, which contains various API keys for LangSmith, OpenAI, and other tools required for this tutorial."
