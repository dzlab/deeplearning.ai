    "# Introduction to LLMs and evals\n",
    "LLM based applications introduce new problems to software testing: non-deterministic output and subjectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLMs work by learning a probability distribution over training data and then predicting the next token to output in a sequence. This introduces randomness, which makes output sound more human like but also makes it difficult to predict what the LLM will say.\n",
    "* Because LLMs deal with text output, there's also more subjectivity. If you're application produces summaries, there are multiple \"good\" ways to answer a question. Similarly with code, there's no universally correct way to write a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also important to note that LLMs can also product harmful, toxic, or offensive content. This is a new problem for application testing compared to traditional software where outputs can be constrained by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with these new testing challenges AI Researchers developed the concept of \"evals\" to assess how well LLMs do at different tasks. There are many common datasets for different tasks including MMLU, hellaswag, and HumanEval. LLMs are tested on different datasets so researchers have a point of comparison between models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard benchmarks are a good starting point, but they don't cover the specifics of __your__ application. In order to assess how well your agents, chatbots, and assistants perform you need to write evaluations for your application's use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you will learn\n",
    "In this course we'll show you how to write those evaluations and automate running them in CircleCI. This will give you a way to see how well your application performs while you build as well as give you a set of tests to run as your application changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* We'll give you a framework to think about:\n",
    "  * What to evaluate - starting with basic evals, using LLM based evals to grade your application output, and dealing with difficult to automate cases\n",
    "  * When to run evaluations:\n",
    "    * Starting with evals when you make application changes\n",
    "    * Running evals before you deploy\n",
